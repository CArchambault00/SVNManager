# NTH
- Or having a split screen. top contain all the patch files and bottom all the locked files not in the patch and be able to just add the files we are missing, this can be helpful, but not a rush to do it.
Just need to drag & drop from bottom to top (for missing a file) or top to bottom (if want to remove a file from the patch)
